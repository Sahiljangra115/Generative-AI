# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a basic self-driving car simulation system in Python that can navigate a simple environment, detect obstacles, and make basic driving decisions. The system will simulate core autonomous vehicle capabilities including perception, decision-making, and control in a simplified 2D environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a car simulation that can move autonomously in a 2D environment, so that I can demonstrate basic self-driving capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a car object with position, velocity, and heading
2. WHEN the car is active THEN the system SHALL continuously update the car's position based on its velocity and heading
3. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the car SHALL move forward automatically without manual input
4. IF the car reaches environment boundaries THEN the system SHALL handle boundary conditions appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the car to detect obstacles in its path, so that it can avoid collisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN obstacles are present in the environment THEN the system SHALL detect obstacles within a specified sensor range
2. WHEN an obstacle is detected ahead THEN the system SHALL identify the obstacle's position relative to the car
3. IF an obstacle is within the collision threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger avoidance behavior
4. WHEN scanning for obstacles THEN the system SHALL provide distance and angle information for detected objects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the car to make steering decisions based on sensor input, so that it can navigate around obstacles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an obstacle is detected on the left THEN the system SHALL steer right to avoid collision
2. WHEN an obstacle is detected on the right THEN the system SHALL steer left to avoid collision
3. WHEN an obstacle is directly ahead THEN the system SHALL choose the optimal steering direction based on available space
4. WHEN no obstacles are detected THEN the system SHALL maintain straight-line movement
5. IF multiple obstacles are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize the closest obstacle for decision-making

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to visualize the car's movement and environment, so that I can observe the self-driving behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation runs THEN the system SHALL display a 2D visualization of the environment
2. WHEN the car moves THEN the system SHALL update the car's visual representation in real-time
3. WHEN obstacles are present THEN the system SHALL render obstacles in the visualization
4. WHEN the car's sensors are active THEN the system SHALL optionally display sensor range and detected objects
5. IF the simulation is running THEN the system SHALL refresh the display at a consistent frame rate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable simulation parameters, so that I can test different scenarios and behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the simulation THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of car speed, sensor range, and environment size
2. WHEN setting up obstacles THEN the system SHALL support adding obstacles at specified positions
3. WHEN running the simulation THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of simulation speed and update frequency
4. IF parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and use default values
